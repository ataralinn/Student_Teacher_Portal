# Student_Teacher_Portal
Our client requested an application that easily allows a student and teacher to communicate. We developed a java application in a group setting, following the Agile approach where we produced progress reports, demos and worked closely with the client. We employed Object Oriented Programming to share our class object with the teacher and student thereby creating easy communication. Our client gave us feedback to each demo and we continued to please the client by fulfilling their requests for changes or new features. We completed the project on time and demonstrated our application via a powerpoint presentation.

This project brought to life for me the benefits and challenges of working with teams as well as the basics of job distribution and the critical importance of communication. I learned how to work on a team, how to split jobs up and communicate with each other. The main lesson I learned was that when there are several coders simultaneously working in one project, clear word distribution parameters, a shared calendar and open and consistent communication are critical to success.
